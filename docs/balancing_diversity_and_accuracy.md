## The Problem:
Traditional GWO approaches focus primarily on maximizing influence spread, potentially overlooking diversity in the chosen seed set. This can lead to selecting nodes clustered in specific network regions, limiting the overall reach of the influence campaign.

## Proposed Solutions:

### Enhanced Seed Set Selection:
- Neighbor Analysis: Analyze the neighbors of nodes in the top probability seed sets identified by GWO.
- Selective Replacement: Prioritize replacing nodes with low influence potential (e.g., low fitness score or low centrality) within the seed set.
- Diversity-Aware Replacement: Implement strategies to avoid replacing nodes with neighbors that are too close (network distance) to existing seed set members. This maintains diversity in the final set.
- Replace based on specific criteria (e.g., minimum fitness threshold for removal).
- Prioritize non-neighbor replacements within the network.
- Utilize network centrality measures (betweenness centrality) to identify influential nodes outside immediate neighborhoods.

### Hybrid Approach:
- Combine GWO fitness score with a diversity score for each node.
- Calculate "simple influencery" for neighbors (e.g., degree centrality, basic diffusion simulation).
- Combine the top neighbors with the original seed set to form an expanded candidate set.
- Calculate fitness and diversity scores for each node in the expanded set.
- Use weighted averages to combine these scores, prioritizing either influence spread or diversity based on research goals.
- Select the final seed set based on the combined score.
